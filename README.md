## Monorepo for microfrontends

###webpack-module-federation

### The project is built using Webpack to divide its services into independent micro-front ends. The build microservices use packages from the main repository.

To launch all services, you need to run commands `npm start`  from the directory:
 - /services/admin/
 - /services/shop/
 - /services/host/
